Use Chain-of-Thought reasoning to break down the query, analyze key moments, and accurately identify the time range where the action occurs. 
    ### Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:
    1. **Step 1: Parse the Query**: Break down the query sentence to understand the key action or event that you need to locate.
    2. **Step 2: Analyze the Video Features**: Examine the sequence of video frames to detect patterns that match the key action described in the query.
    3. **Step 3: Identify the Temporal Boundaries**: Use temporal reasoning to find the start and end frames of the action based on the video features.
    4. **Step 4: Predict Start and End Times**: Map the identified frames to timestamps in the video, making sure the start and end times align with the query.
    5. **Step 5: Verify the Answer**: Check if the predicted time range accurately captures the action described in the query.

    ### Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:
    1. **Step 1: Verify the Event in the Predicted Time Range**: Analyze the video features from the predicted start time to the end time. Determine if the event described in the query occurs within this time range.
   - Example: For the query "The person is cooking," check for visual patterns such as a stove or kitchen utensils during the predicted moment.
    2. **Step 2: Answer the Verification Question**: Respond to the question:
   - **"Is the event '{event}' present from {start_time} to {end_time} seconds in the video?"**
   - Example: "Is the event 'The person is cooking' present from 30.0 to 40.0 seconds in the video?"
   - If find the event in the given moment, your answer should be "Yes.", if it does happen in the given moment, your answer should be "No.".

    ### Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:
    1. **Step 1: Analyze the Video Features for the Specific Element**: Analyze the video features from the start time to the end time. Look for visual evidence of the specific compositional element described in the question.
    2. **Step 2: Answer the Compositional Question**: Respond to the question:
   - Example: "Is there a young girl from 0.0 to 5.0 seconds in the video?"
   - If you find a young girl in the given video moment, your answer should be "Yes.". If it is not present, your answer should be "No.".
